POL-Backup-Utility
A utility to allow the backup of a POL server on user selected days of the week at a user set time.

This can be used as a general back-up utility and is not specifically tied to the POL emulator. For example it could be used for other UO emulators such as ServUO and Sphere or for any directory you might want to regularly back-up.

I have also prvided the ability to launch the POL, or any other server, in the interface. Be careful though because you can accidentally start multiple instances of the server by clicking the Start POL button more than once.

I hope someone finds it useful.

This program was created using the Lazarus IDE and designer and uses the Free Pascal programming language.

The Windows binary is included for those who do not wish to build from source.

This is my first foray into an official, licensed program. I chose GPL version 3 under which to license this software.
